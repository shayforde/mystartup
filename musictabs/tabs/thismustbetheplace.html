[Intro]
G Am Bm Am 2x

[Verse]
G    Am    Bm              Am
Home... is where I want to be

        G      Am      Bm     Am
Pick me up and turn me round

     G   Am  Bm               Am
I go numb... born with a weak heart

  G                Am     Bm   Am
I guess we must be having fun

    G            Am          Bm      Am
The less we say about it the better

      G             Am     Bm    Am
We'll make it up as we go along

G           Am
Feet on the ground

Bm          Am
Head in the sky

G             Am               Em
It's alright, I know nothing's wrong.. nothing's wrong


[Chorus]
G    Am    Bm       Am        G     Am Bm Am
   Heeeeey... I got plenty of time

G    Am    Bm         Am            G     Am Bm Am
   Heeeeey... you got light in your eyes

[Verse]
           G        Am     Bm       Am
And you're standing here beside me

G             Am         Bm    Am
   I love the passage of time

G            Am
   Never for money

Bm            Am
   Always for love

G            Am      Em
Cover up and say goodnight... say goodnight

[Bridge] 

G Am Em Am 2x

[Verse]
G   Am   Em              Am
Home, is where I want to be

      G           Am    Em     Am
But I guess I'm already there

       G    Am     Em            Am
I come home... she lifted up her wings

  G                    Am     Em     Am
I guess that this must be the place

G            Am           Em     Am
I can't tell one from the other

    G              Am       Em   Am
Did I find you, or you find me?

G           Am
There was a time 

  Em           Am
Before we were born

   G             Am                 Em
If someone asks, this is where I'll be... where I'll be

 
[Chorus]
G    Am    Em    Am            G   Am Em Am
   Heeeeey... we drift in and out

G    Am   Em      Am      G      Am Em Am
   Heeeey... sing into my mouth
 

[Verse]
       G         Am       Em      Am
Out of all those kinds of people

G            Am          Em    Am
   You got a face with a view

G              Am      Em            Am
   I'm just an animal, looking for a home, and

G                 Am          Em        Am
   Share the same space for a minute or two

 
[Verse]
        G       Am      Em           Am
And you love me till my heart stops

G          Am       Em    Am
   Love me 'til I'm dead

G              Am Em            Am
   Eyes light up, I see through you

G             Am
Cover up your blank spot, and

Em            Am
Hit me on the head, like...

[Outro]
   G Am Em Am       G Am Em Am
Ay-eeeeeeeeeeee...

         G Am Em Am    G Am Em Am
Like, ay-eeeeeeeeeeee

         G Am Em Am    G Am Em Am
Like, ay-eeeeeeeeeeee

G
