Letter to Hermione - David Bowie
(from Space Oddity album)

This is one of the most beautiful songs from Bowie. I've been looking for
it for some time but I haven't been able to find it so I thougt I'd figure
it out myself. If you listen to the record you can hear that there are more
than one guitar, or at least a twelve-string.

Verse1.

    Am7                                    C/G
The hand that wrote this letter Sweeps the pillow clean
Am7                          C/G
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
Em7sus4                    Em*
I care for no one else but you
                            C/G*
I tear my soul to cease the pain
                           Em7sus4*
I think maybe you feel the same
            Em*
What can we do?
C/G*                            Em7sus4
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
Em*
So I've been writing just for you

Verse2.

They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do I
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay


Verse3.

He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you
