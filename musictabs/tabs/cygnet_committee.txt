/ David Bowie / Space Oddity (1969) / Cygnet Committee guitar tab


From: winston campbell 
Subject: THE CYGNET COMMITTEE by David Bowie

This song took me two hours to figure out.  It is probably, in my opinion,
one of the greatest David Bowie songs.  It is off of -Space Oddity- and 
quite a track coming in at over nine minutes.  It is quite a piece moving
through so many key changes and other things.  Those are things 
characteristic of -Space Oddity-, figuring out songs off that album is   
quite difficult.  I was quite frustrated trying to get some of it but now 
that I got all of it, I am quite proud and happy I did it.  I am typing   
this on a word processor program that does not show any quotation or
apostrophe marks.  So to not cause any confusion on the lyrics, I will     
use a ~ for an apostrophe and ~~ for both open and closed quotation marks.   
I took the lyrics right off of the album and even capitalized a lot of   
things  that were capitalized on the album sleeve. I hope you enjoy this,  
(it took me a really strenuous long time to do but I did enjoy doing it
anyway):

D            D/C
I bless you madly
Bm    Bb           D
Sadly as I tie my shoe
            D/C
I love you badly
Bm       Bb                D   D/C
Just in time, at times, I guess
  Bm        Bb            D   D/C
Because of you I need to rest
 Bm          Bb                 D
Because it~s you that sets the test

Eb                    Bbm
So much has gone and little is new
Bbm           A
And as the sparrow sings
       F#
Dawn chorus for
 Bbm             
Someone else to hear
Bbm          A
The thinker sits alone
  F#     Bbm
Growing older

And so bitter

F                               Bbm
~~I gave Them life, I gave Them all
     C                Fm
They drained my very soul...dry
F                                 Bbm
I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
      C              Fm         Ab
No thought for me remains there
Bbm              Db
Nothing can they spare
         C
What of me?

Am					   F
Who praised Their efforts to be free?
 G					    C
Words of strength and care and sympathy
Am							  F
I open doors that would have blocked their way
   G							C
I braved Their cause to guide for little pay
Am					     F
I ravaged at my finanace just for Those
		 G						 C
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Am							  F
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
				    G					   C
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me.~~

Am     F      G


D	  	 D/C
I bless you madly
 Bm	Bb		 D
Sadly as I tie my shoe
		D/C
I love you badly
 Bm	   Bb			    D   D/C
Just in time, at times, I guess
  Bm		Bb		  D   D/C
Because of you I need to rest
  Bm		  Bb			  D
Because it~s you that sets the test

Eb			    Bbm
So much has gone and little is new
Bbm		 A
And as the sunrise stream
 F#		Bbm
Flickers on me
		   Bbm	   A
My friends talk of glory, untold dream
	F#		   Bbm
Where all is God and God is just a word

F				     Bbm
~~We had a friend, a talking man
	C		  Fm
Who spoke of many powers that he had
 F				    Bbm
Not of the best of men but Ours
    C				  Fm		  Ab
We used him, We let him use his powers
   Bbm			Db
We let him fill our needs	
		 C
Now we are strong.

Am					 F
And the road is coming to its end
 G						   C
Now the damned have not time to make amends
Am							F
No purse of token fortunes stands in Our way
     G					    C
The silent guns of love will blast the sky

Am							F
We broke the ruptured structure build of age
	G					C
Our weapons were tongues of crying rage
	 Am						F
Where money stood we planted seeds of rebirth
	G						 C
And stabbed the backs of fathers, sons of dirt

  Am			
Infiltrated business cesspools
		    F
Hating through Our sleeves
		 G				
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
			   C
Stoned the poor on slogans as:


	-Wish You Could Hear-
			     Am
	-Love Is All We Need-

	-Kick Out The Jams-

	-Kick Out Your Mother-
	  F
	-Cut Up Your Friend-
						   G
	-Screw Up Your Brother or He~ll Get You In the End-

	  C						Am
And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
		F
And We Can Force You to Be Free
		G			   C
And We Can Force You to Believe.~~

				  Am
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
						  F
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
							G
For they Knew not the words of the Free States~ refrain,

It said:

 C			
~~I Believe in the Power of Good
    Am
I Believe in the State of Love
	   F
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
	  G								
C
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right.~~

		   Am			   F
And I open my eyes to look around
						 G
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
C			  Am
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
F			   G
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
	   C
But not hearing anymore-
        Am		 F
Not hearing anymore
		G
Just the shrieks from the old rich

		    C
And I Want to Believe
			   G
In the madness that calls ~Now~
		    C
And I Want to Believe
				   G
That a light is shining through somehow

		    Bb
And I Want to Believe
			F
And You Want to Believe
		     C
And We Want to Believe
		    G
And We Want to Live
		    Ab
Oh, We Want to Live
		Bb
We Want to Live
		C
We Want to Live


(marching-type beat configuration appears)

	     G
We Want to Live
		Ab
We Want to Live
		Bb
We Want To Live
		C
I Want to Live

I Want to Live
